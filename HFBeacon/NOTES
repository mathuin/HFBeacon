HFBeacon 2.0 notes

0.  Add tests for all existing features.
	Yes, even the ones that are to be disabled!

1.  Convert timer thread to a service - DONE!
	The handler has been moved to a service.  The service accepts transactions from the activity to
	change the band and offset.  The service sends broadcasts to the activity containing the beacons
	to be displayed.
    
2.  Implement local offset - partly done.
	The service accepts offset transactions from the activity.
	The activity needs to offer a menu page for setting the offset.
	
3.  Implement multiple sources for local offset.
	The service currently stores the offset in the preferences.
	It will need to store the offset and type when multiple sources are supported.
	
4.  Degree-minute versus degree-minute-second.
	The position displayed needs to be cleaned up.
	The selection of DM versus DMS needs to be in the preferences.
	Perhaps the location listener should change based on the DM/DMS setting?
	If so, use HALF_MINUTE_IN_METERS (900) and HALF_SECOND_IN_METERS (15).
	Consider warning about power usage with DMS level.
	DEFERRED - for now, just setting it to DMS but Readable functions will support both.
	

5.  Internationalization.
	Fake it for Spanish, French, and German.  Ask for updates.
	
6.  Fixed versus mobile.
	Exit after a single location detected.
	Notify users to hit home then re-enter the app when their location changes.
	Perhaps add a preferences checkbox for mobile versus fixed and default fixed?
	
7.  Beacon-specific view.
	Make a drop-down listing all the beacons.
	When a beacon is selected, show the standard info plus seconds until beacon transmits on selected band.
	Allow band to be changed in this view, and make it a global change.

8.  Audio files for specific beacons.
	Perhaps have a button to play the specific beacon's transmission?
	Perhaps have a flag to play the beacon exactly when it should be received for fine-tuning offset?
