HFBeacon 2.0 notes

1.  Convert timer thread to a service - DONE!
	The handler has been moved to a service.  The service accepts transactions from the activity to
	change the band and offset.  The service sends broadcasts to the activity containing the beacons
	to be displayed.
    
2.  Implement local offset - DONE!
	The service accepts offset transactions from the activity.
	The activity needs to offer a menu page for setting the offset.
	
4.  Degree-minute versus degree-minute-second - DONE!
	The default is to use degree-minute-second.
	The location listener changes based on the DM/DMS setting.
	No warning about power usage at this time.
	
5.  Internationalization.
	Fake it for Spanish, French, and German.  Ask for updates.

For the future:
	
0.  Add tests for all existing features.
	Yes, even the ones that are to be disabled!

3.  Implement multiple sources for local offset - DEFERRED.
	The service currently stores the offset in the preferences.
	It will need to store the offset and type when multiple sources are supported.
	
6.  Fixed versus mobile.
	Exit after a single location detected.
	Notify users to hit home then re-enter the app when their location changes.
	Perhaps add a preferences checkbox for mobile versus fixed and default fixed?
	
7.  Beacon-specific view.
	Make a drop-down listing all the beacons.
	When a beacon is selected, show the standard info plus seconds until beacon transmits on selected band.
	Allow band to be changed in this view, and make it a global change.

8.  Audio files for specific beacons.
	Perhaps have a button to play the specific beacon's transmission?
	Perhaps have a flag to play the beacon exactly when it should be received for fine-tuning offset?
