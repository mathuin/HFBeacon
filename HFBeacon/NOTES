HFBeacon 2.0 notes

0.  Add tests for all existing features.
	Yes, even the ones that are to be disabled!

1.  Convert timer thread to a service.
    Next I need to change the timer into a service.  The service should send a broadcast message every 10s.
    The main application needs to be changed to listen for the timer service's broadcast message.
    The service needs to tell the app which beacon is currently broadcasting on 14.100.
    The app will have to make the band-specific adjustments.
    
2.  Implement local offset.
    I already made a note in updateBeacons where the offset should be applied.
    Initially, the offset will come from a text field in the preferences or something.
	The service needs to be initialized with the offset.
	
3.  Implement multiple sources for local offset.
	All methods get added to the preferences and settings.
	When offset changes, service needs to be notified.
	Perhaps the service should be in charge of determining offset when not manual?
	
4.  Degree-minute versus degree-minute-second.
	The position displayed needs to be cleaned up.
	The selection of DM versus DMS needs to be in the preferences.
	Perhaps the location listener should change based on the DM/DMS setting?
	Consider warning about power usage with DMS level.
	
5.  Fixed versus mobile.
	Exit after a single location detected.
	Notify users to hit home then re-enter the app when their location changes.
	Perhaps add a preferences checkbox for mobile versus fixed and default fixed?
	
6.  Beacon-specific view.
	Make a drop-down listing all the beacons.
	When a beacon is selected, show the standard info plus seconds until beacon transmits on selected band.
	Allow band to be changed in this view, and make it a global change.

7.  Audio files for specific beacons.
	Perhaps have a button to play the specific beacon's transmission?
	Perhaps have a flag to play the beacon exactly when it should be received for fine-tuning offset?
